### Welcome to my blog :)

Hi, I'm Aaditya, a CS undergrad from India. I mostly code in Golang, but sometimes use Rust and Python as well. Also somewhat decent with Docker, SQL and Arduino. I'm mostly interested in developing backend systems, along with a bit of Ops and systems stuff so expect me to mostly cover those topics on here. Big Linux geek who constantly distrohops, currently on Arch btw :^)

Prompt and neofetch, as is customary to share :)

_Using `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh` and `starship` prompt._
